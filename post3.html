                        <p>
                            This project is a Discord bot I am currently developing for Minecraft server management through Discord. The bot is made in Python
                            using Discord.py to read and send messages through Discord chat. Essentially, the bot will monitor a specific text channel for when
                            commands are given to it using a special command character which is denoted as "/". When a command is given it will use MCRcon which
                            is a Python library for handling Minecraft Remote Commands (RCON) to execute the correct Minecraft RCON corresponding with the Discord
                            command that was given. The list of commands will be provided below.
                        </p>

                                <p>
                                    /online - Display list of all players that are online on the Minecraft server to the Discord chat.<br>
                                    /wl - Display list of all players that are whitelisted on the server.<br>
                                    /awl (name) - To add someone to the server whitelist.<br>
                                    /dwl (name) - To remove someone from the server whitelist.<br>
                                    /login - For administrators to manually connect the bot to the Minecraft server via MCRcon. This was mostly for debugging.<br>
                                </p>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Currently the bot is only being used for one server and is able to connect to the Minecraft server using the server ip, server port,
                            and server password. Since this project is on GitHub I do not want to be uploading sensitive information. Therefore I use a .env and a
                            .gitignore to keep the credentials locally, while the usable code is pushed onto the repo. This means someone can take the code and fill
                            in the server ip, port, and password fields to use on their own server. Furthermore, the bot itself is being hosted on Heroku.
