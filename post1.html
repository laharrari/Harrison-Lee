                        <h4>MapleStory Private Server</h4>
                        <h6>March 2020 - July 2020</h6>
                        <p>
                            MapleStory was and still is a popular MMORPG my friends and I grew up playing. I was able to get the source code of an older
                            iteration of the game which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS">here</a>. The code base
                            was mostly in Java and JavaScript. It required using NetBeans to build a JAR file which could be executed to launch the server.
                            There was also a client included for users in order to launch the playable game. Interestingly, the server IP was hard coded in
                            the client which meant in order to update the server IP for players it required using a Hex Editor and changing 3 very specific
                            lines to the new IP.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            One of the scripts I developed was a shop for players to buy whatever items they may need. I picked an existing non-player
                            character (NPC) that could be used as a shop keeper and created a database holding all the items they were going to sell. I used
                            WampServer to connect to the database and MySQL Query Browser to make changes. Looking back on it now, the JavaScript file that
                            the NPC used is quite redundant. I feel I could have used some arithmetic and looping to cut down on the lines of code. During
                            the development of this NPC I was getting quite frustrated with some communication errors between the server and database that I
                            just got lazy and copy pasted code. I definitely could clean the code up and the link to the repo can be found
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/laharrari/MapleStory-Private-Server">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The game was hosted on AWS Lightsail. I created a Windows Lightsail instance because the project had a MySQL Query
                            Browser and WampServer dependency which forced me into using a Windows operating system over a Linux/Unix. A Linux/Unix instance
                            in the long run would have been cheaper as well as easier to use with FTP. I also investigated Azure solutions since I was going
                            to use Windows, but I felt AWS was a better choice mainly due the cost and AWS's reputation for being very reliable. I feel
                            if I did do this project again I would use Azure just to experience it myself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I was unaware that FTP Server/Services did not come pre-configured on Windows instances. This required many hours of debugging
                            and researching to finally install and setup FTP Server/Services on the Windows instance. Perhaps because Lightsail is new-ish?
                            it was difficult to find resources that were specific to Lightsail. Often times I was pointed towards an EC2 solution or a solution
                            I've already investigated, because of this I was sure to document my solution which I will provide below.

                                I've found a solution to my problem. It turns out by default on Windows 2016/2012 instances of AWS Lightsail, FTP<br>
                                Server/Service does not come installed by default. I had to install FTP Server/Service using the Windows Server<br>
                                Manager. Although I only have FTP working at the moment, I plan on figuring out how to SFTP using my AWS SSH key<br>
                                (If that is how it's supposed to work). At the moment without SFTP, I am connecting with FileZilla using my default<br>
                                user name, password, public ip, and port 21.<br>
                                <br>
                                An excellent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENpkZTfTlWw">video</a> reference I used for installing
                                and configuring my FTP Server.<br>
                                <br>
                                Also after installing FTP Server, do not forget to add a Firewall rule on the Networking tab of your Lightsail instance for<br>
                                Port 21 (TCP).
                                </p>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Another challenge I faced with this project was because I was making changes to code on my machine and hosting the server on AWS Lightsail.
                            Whenever I had to apply those changes to the server I would have to connect to FileZilla, transfer the relevant files, and reboot the server.
                            This process was really tedious and I wish I could have figured out a better work flow for the project. After using Heroku on some of my more
                            recent projects, I feel there could have been a way I could have monitored changes to a Git repo then automatically built and deployed to my
                            server on Lightsail. This is something I will be considering moving forward and need to investigate. I definitely need to be automating my work
                            when I can.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In the end, although there were hiccups in the beginning. After the first week, the server was stable and was almost always up. With down times
                            occurring during planned server restarts. I wanted this to be a trip down memory lane for my friends and I, with an opportunity to learn something
                            new. During the servers up time I had on average 5 concurrent players with 20 unique players.
