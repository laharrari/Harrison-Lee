                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This website was made in HTML/CSS with some JavaScript for changing colors between themes and some graphics. I used a AWS S3
                            bucket to host a static website with AWS Route 53 to create name servers for a custom domain. I purchased my very unique domain
                            from Google Domains and used custom name servers which were the 4 name servers I got from my Route 53 record sets. To take it
                            a step further I used AWS CodePipeline with GitHub for continuous deployment of this website!

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Continuous deployment is important to me because on the <a target="_blank" href="post1.html">MapleStory Private Server</a> I was
                            not able to setup a good workflow to pipeline all my changes. I had to do a lot of manual work between my machine and the AWS Lightsail
                            instance. So moving forward from that project I wanted to learn from my mistakes and make my life easier by setting up pipelines such
                            as the one I made for this website where I can just make changes to one repo instead of having to make changes on my machine, the repo,
                            and S3 bucket.
                        </p>
