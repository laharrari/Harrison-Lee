                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This project started becuase my friends and I enjoyed watching YouTube videos together and wanted a convenient way we could watch in sync.
                            There is also a real-time chat that allows users in the same "theater" to chat with each other. A theater is essentially a custom video
                            viewing room for users to join. I developed the front end in React with Tailwind CSS to style the components. The backend uses
                            Express.js and Socket.io to create theaters.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            A high level description would be a username and theater room name which is essentially is a code is given by the user. This takes the user
                            to a new page where the url includes the username and theater name. Those two details are parsed using query selector and when a connection
                            is made, it is emitted to socket where it creates a new user object. When the user makes actions such as sending chat messages, socket emits
                            the message that was sent and the relevant client side components catch the changes to update the view for all the users that are in the same
                            room.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Some features are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    - Users can create "Theaters" with custom names so users can have their private viewings for their party.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - There is a functional real-time chat, still needs styling but emojis work.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - YouTube player is working, but not synchronized for all users in a Theater.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
